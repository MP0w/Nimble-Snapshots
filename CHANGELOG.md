# Nimble-Snapshots

* Improved failure messages by removing the prefix ", got" - @MP0w

## 4.3.0

* Adds support for testing dynamic type - @marcelofabri
  
  You need the use the new subspec to enjoy this new feature:

    ```ruby
    pod 'Nimble-Snapshots/DynamicType'
    ```

  Then you can use the new `haveValidDynamicTypeSnapshot` and `recordDynamicTypeSnapshot` matchers to use it:

    ```swift
    // expect(view).to(recordDynamicTypeSnapshot()
    expect(view).to(haveValidDynamicTypeSnapshot())

    // You can also just test some sizes:
    expect(view).to(haveValidDynamicTypeSnapshot(sizes: [UIContentSizeCategoryExtraLarge]))

    // If you prefer the == syntax, we got you covered too:
    expect(view) == dynamicTypeSnapshot()
    expect(view) == dynamicTypeSnapshot(sizes: [UIContentSizeCategoryExtraLarge])
    ```

  Note that this will post an `UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification`, so your views/view controllers
  need to observe that and update themselves.

  For more info on usage, check the [dynamic type tests](Bootstrap/BootstrapTests/DynamicTypeTests.swift).
    
* Removes support for Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.2 - @marcelofabri
* Adds Swift 2.3/3.0 support - @carezone

## 4.1.0

* Adds `tolerance` so you can specify tolerance of reference image differences – @mpurland

## 4.0.1

* Adds `recordSnapshot(name=nil)` so you can use `expect(thing) == recordSnapshot()` as this feels much nicer than
  writing `expect(thing).to( recordSnapshot() )` - I'm still not over this `to( thing() )`' bit in Quick. Looks messy. - @orta

## 4.0.0

* Nimble-Snapshots does not call `view?.drawViewHierarchyInRect(bounds, afterScreenUpdates: true)` on your views by default. - @orta

  If this is something that you need in order to get your snapshots passing, you should look at two options:

  - Adding the view to an existing window, then calling `drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:` - this
    is the technique that is used inside `FBSnapshotTestController`, which we now expose as an option in `recordSnapshot`
    and `haveValidSnapshot` as `usesDrawRect`

    ``` swift
        expect(imageView).to( recordSnapshot(usesDrawRect: true) )
        expect(imageView).to( haveValidSnapshot(usesDrawRect: true) )
    ```

  - Spending time looking in how you can remove Async code from your App. Or look for places where you are relying on a view structure
    which isn't set up in your tests. There are a bunch of examples in https://github.com/orta/pragmatic-testing on removing Async.
